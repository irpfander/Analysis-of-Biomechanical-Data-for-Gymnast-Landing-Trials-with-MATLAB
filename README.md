# Analysis-of-Biomechanical-Data-for-Gymnast-Landing-Trials-with-MATLAB
This project was completed using MATLAB. I examined signal processing data collected from landing trials of young gymnasts. My team analyzed the differences in vertical force and mediolateral center of pressure for each trial. Our analysis showed consistent relationships between the stiffness and balance of the landings relative to the gymnasts' dominant and non-dominant legs.
